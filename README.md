# Texas_Home_Sold_Prediction
Given a county in Texas and a median price for a home, the model will return the estimated number of homes to be sold in that county at that price over the next year. 
The data being used is from Zillow and covers real estate trends in each Texas county from 2020-2024. To predict the total homes sold over the next year, I use various independent varables including the median sale price per square foot of homes sold during a given time period per county, the total active listings per county per time period, the total inventory in a county year over year, amongst some others. The Linear Regresssion model will take as input from the user a county name and a median price and return the total number of homes predicted to be sold in the next year.
